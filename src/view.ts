				// So about Dataview.
				//
				// Dataview does a lot.  Some of it helpful, some of it... imo, kind of a waste of time.
				// The helpful parts are so numerous they don't bear listing.
				// The less helpful parts:
				//   - Every field in the frontmatter that's got capital letters?  It gets cloned to a downcased one.
				//      -> this makes it confusing to range over the set because it's got duplicates!
				//      -> it's also a waste of memory!  Big sigh.
				//   - Anything that looks like a date got parsed to a Luxon DateTime object already!
				//      -> cool for the purpose of dv queries themselves...
				//      -> it's a little wasteful for our purposes, because we're just gonna turn around and integrate with another API that doesn't use that format.
				//      -> and when I said "date"?  I mean with YYYY-MM-DD.  It doesn't detect or do anything with HH:MM.
				//   - DV has gathered outlinks, inlinks, tasks, lists...
				//      -> the latter two don't really matter much in practice (event file contents are pretty short), but it's unnecessary work.
				//      -> inlinks required DV to index and parse *how much??* of my vault?  Very unnecessary work.
				//
				// The way to safely ignore all this is to peep `.file.frontmatter`.  That has the originals.
				// And I think someday we might have a compelling argument for making our own simpler query system that does _less_.
				// (Or find some flags to DV that ask it to Do Less; that'd be great.)
				//
				const dv = getAPI();
				const pages = dv.pages('"sys/horizoncal"')
					.where(p => String(p.file.name).startsWith("evt-"))
				//.where(p => p.file.day - weekStart >= 0 && p.file.day - weekStart < dvdur("7d")) // how does dv infer this?
				//.sort((p) => p.file.name, 'asc')
				console.log("dv shows this:", pages[0])

				// TODO emit a warning for things with no TZ?  or instantly fixate it?
				// Korganizer just shamelessly did everything in Zulu and ... I don't love it for that but also never honestly noticed.
				// Thing is, I *like* my convention of "i'm just rendering everything as local to the timezone i'll be in at the time".
				// Scrolling across years of data and the "working hours" stay in the middle of the screen is fucking great.
				// The trouble is that it objectively loses information.
				// Can I have fullcalendar render different days with different prevailing TZs?
				// Can I have it switch TZ midday?  Probably not lol, because what even.
				// The only reason that defacto was a nonissue for me was that flights were always still slightly longer than the timeshift.
				// The most egregious possible way to hack this together is render two calendars and one day gets shown twice with partial content (and then render a dummy background event to say "whoopsie"; and good luck with things that cross the line.).
				// Another option is just to add extra buttons and prompts that let you switch view mode fast when you scroll onto days that have other TZs.
				// This could be combined with background events that make rendered warnings about TZ shifts.  Maybe.  (Tricky to infer where that should be drawn exactly.)
				// (I'm thinking also about the business hours built in feature being a bit comical here.)
				// Not sure that having events with other TZs is actually the cue to use.  That happens for meetings on shared calendars all the time.
				// A custom event that's a marker for "shift my view please" is probably actually totally reasonable though!
				// Maybe these should have Special filename patterns so we can pluck them out at great range.  It's something I'd wanna base a lot on, for months at a time.
