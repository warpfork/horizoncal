				// So about Dataview.
				//
				// Dataview does a lot.  Some of it helpful, some of it... imo, kind of a waste of time.
				// The helpful parts are so numerous they don't bear listing.
				// The less helpful parts:
				//   - Every field in the frontmatter that's got capital letters?  It gets cloned to a downcased one.
				//      -> this makes it confusing to range over the set because it's got duplicates!
				//      -> it's also a waste of memory!  Big sigh.
				//   - Anything that looks like a date got parsed to a Luxon DateTime object already!
				//      -> cool for the purpose of dv queries themselves...
				//      -> it's a little wasteful for our purposes, because we're just gonna turn around and integrate with another API that doesn't use that format.
				//      -> and when I said "date"?  I mean with YYYY-MM-DD.  It doesn't detect or do anything with HH:MM.
				//   - DV has gathered outlinks, inlinks, tasks, lists...
				//      -> the latter two don't really matter much in practice (event file contents are pretty short), but it's unnecessary work.
				//      -> inlinks required DV to index and parse *how much??* of my vault?  Very unnecessary work.
				//
				// The way to safely ignore all this is to peep `.file.frontmatter`.  That has the originals.
				// And I think someday we might have a compelling argument for making our own simpler query system that does _less_.
				// (Or find some flags to DV that ask it to Do Less; that'd be great.)
				// 
				type DVT_Record = Record<string, Literal> & {file: TFile};
				const dv = getAPI();
				const pages = dv.pages('"sys/horizoncal"')
					// TODO need this to be as un-eager as possible.
					// I think `.pages` is already gonna load and parse all those, so... no, bad.
					// "Dataview indexes its sources internally" states their docs, but I'm going to hope it doesn't do so proactively either.
					//
					// might be strongest to make our own func that starts teh DataArray chaining,
					// because this startsWith being *after* we're all the way in DataArray land?  yeah, not efficient.
					// We need to be able to pluck files with certain prefixes out of 10000 files without loading and indexing them all.
					// ...
					// increasingly, I think maybe we just... don't need or derive much value from DV at all.
					// I'm already not using any of their loading nor swizzling.
					// Letting DV do caching is about the only virtue I see but even that's a bit "hmmm".
					//
					// For offering easy integrations though: oh,
					// gross.  `dv.pagePaths` also still takes a string, not even a list lol.  I'm kinda not okay with that.
					// At first I was thinking "we can just offer a func that transforms date ranges into a list of file loading patterns",
					// but... a stringconcat of those?  Really?  Really?
					// The alternative is diving deeper and offering a function that glues together DV's `DataArray.from` and flatmaps that over `dv.page` and so on and so on.
					// Possible.  But would definitely require us to have import their package to do that stuff, and I'm... oof.  I'm Unsure.
					//
					// DOn't forget you still have the much, much simpler option of just calling `dv.pages` repeatedly and then conjoining it.
					// That DOES strongly push you to use folders per day, though.
					// So I guess we should do that and come back to the rest later.

					// Still going to have to have to call `page` (not `pages`) with specific targets to handle getting Tzch events.
					// 
					// Wonder if doing two months is actually just shrug for scale.  Probably is.
					
					// The other tiebreaker here is: moving a bunch of files in per-day dirs up one as a migration is trivial.
					// Adding another layer of dirs requires bothering to write code.
					//
					// Also i'm pretty sure obsidian itself is indexing at least all filenames proactively.  So it's free to look at that.
